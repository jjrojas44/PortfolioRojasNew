<h9>Interview Plan/Interview Transcript
</h9>
 
<p>For our interviews, we aimed to discover how users planned their trips, how they handled the booking, and how their journeys went. We also sought information on how travel changed for them due to covid.
We interviewed one person we knew who had gone on a trip since the start of the pandemic, preferably during this year. During this, we let them describe their latest journey.
</p>
<P> In this research project, we planned and conducted 6 interviews with potential users of various ages from 25-60.

  <h9>Affinity Diagram</h9>
  <p> We used an affinity diagram to organize many ideas about travel and booking into their natural relationships. The organized output from a brainstorming session led us to several ideas on how to proceed with travel-savvy. Using the affinity diagram to generate, organize, and consolidate information related to travel savvy. After we developed ideas, we grouped them according to their affinity or similarity.</p>

  <h9>User Insight</h9>
  <p> A young male educator needs a way to experience travel within his budget that also considers covid safety protocol. Saving money for emergencies and future expenses is essential to him and not putting his health at risk. He does not want to be debilitated by an illness and potentially spread it to his family/friends. The young male would also like to get rid of his shy, introverted nature by going to the high-traffic location to get used to large crowds and get rid of his timid nature. The young male would also like to take his photography hobby to new heights, take plenty of photos for his collections, and learn new things about the culture of his destination. </p>
  <div class="pictures">

      </div>

      <h9>Problem Statement</h9>
  <p>Travelers face difficulty with traveling within their budget and ensuring they are safe amid a pandemic, with new variants and constant rise and fall of cases. Travelers would like to be aware of the latest travel constraints with the new omicron variant of covid and need to ensure the covid restrictions put in place by the country of their destination desire. The families also have to keep in mind to be vaccinated as most countries require vaccinations and to be up to date. Travelers also have to keep in mind a good budgeting and travel plan, especially if traveling internationally, be aware of the exchange rate, and read up and educate on the country's culture of destination not to go wholly ignorant and be somewhat self-aware.

      <h9>Ideation</h9>
  <p> We used Ideation to have a creative process on what to add to travel-savvy, including features and gimmicks to the app to help plan the dream vacation, and we generated ideas in sessions (e.g., brainstorming).</p>

<h9>Feature Prioritization Matrix</h9>
<p>We ranked and organized features and needs of travel savvy in a product based on customer value, business goals, time and cost, technical viability for parts to be added, and some features that will be optional to prioritize to ensure time consciousness and effectiveness. </p>

<h9>Value Proposition</h9>
<p> My organization Travel Savvy is developing a travel app to help people plan the perfect vacation in the post covid world by informing them of the covid restrictions and rules of different travel destinations. We also intend to help these people with travel preparation, from planning to booking.
  Travel savvy is better because of our customer-friendly services, in-depth research on different travel destinations, our complete package of budgeting/travel plans, and our above-and-beyond support to help give you the best possible vacation.
  We may be new to the app market, but we are dedicated to researching the different procedures and risk levels of areas concerning covid so we can provide them to you. Furthermore, we’re believable because we’re willing to include a money-back guarantee to any user who has found our services lacking within a particular time window of their vacation.</p>

<h9>User Scenerio</h9>

        <h9>Final Thoughts/Conclusion</h9>
      <p>We initially wanted to create a simplified version of Airbnb emphasizing safety and Covid. However, after much trial and error, we realized that creating that is a lot easier said than done. One of our key findings was realizing we needed fewer words and more consistency throughout the app not to confuse or frustrate the user (For example, making titles consistent throughout and deleting paragraphs about Covid and replacing them with a button). Also, we realized some of the tools were redundant on some of the pages. Our finalized version is less frustrating, simple, and user-friendly.
