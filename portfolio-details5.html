		    <p>A UX/UI redesign of the Universal Orlando website could bring many benefits, including improving the user experience for visitors to the site and potentially increasing revenue for the company. According to the average salary for a Universal Studios UX/UI Designer is around $125k per year, indicating that the company places a high value on the importance of good design. The website redesign could draw inspiration from the immersive design techniques used in Universal Studios' theme parks, as discussed in. By prioritizing user feedback and making it easy for users to achieve their goals, the website could achieve operational excellence and a superior guest experience, as mentioned in. </p>

    <h9>User Insight</h9>
    <hr class="new2">
    <p>An insight into the potential user of a theme park website or app could be a young, adventurous, and outgoing person passionate about theme parks, thrill rides, and creating memorable experiences. They may be well-educated and have a busy careers, but they make time for leisure activities like theme park vacations and enjoy sharing those experiences with friends and family. This user may be interested in discovering new parks, rides, and experiences and may prioritize planning and organizing their park visits to maximize their time and enjoyment. A website or app catering to this user could offer features such as ride wait times, virtual maps of parks, and recommendations for new and exciting attractions. This user values excitement, adventure, and shared experiences with loved ones.  </p>

        <hr class="new2">
        <p> How might we create a theme park website or app that caters to adventurous and extroverted young professionals like Sherri, by providing personalized recommendations for new and exciting thrill rides and experiences, facilitating easy planning and organization of park visits, and promoting the creation of memorable shared experiences with friends and family despite busy schedules.</p>

            <p> For adventurous and extroverted young professionals like Sherri, who prioritize creating unforgettable memories with friends and family through theme park vacations despite busy work schedules, our theme park website or app provides personalized recommendations for new and exciting thrill rides and experiences, facilitates easy planning and organization of park visits, and promotes social connections and shared experiences.</p>

    <h9>Problem Statement</h9>
    <hr class="new2">
    <p>Even though Sherri is an avid theme park fan and loves taking theme park vacations, no website or app caters to her specific needs as an adventurous and extroverted young professional with a busy work schedule. Existing theme park websites and apps do not provide personalized recommendations for new and exciting thrill rides and experiences. They do not facilitate easy planning and organizing of park visits that prioritize social connections and shared experiences with friends and family. As a result, Sherri and others like her may struggle to create unforgettable theme park experiences amidst their busy lives.

              <h9>Affinity Diagram</h9>
              <hr class="new2">
              <p> An affinity diagram is a useful tool for organizing information about a person or topic, such as Sherri Owens' love of theme parks, extroverted nature, career, and personal traits. This diagram can help identify connections and key themes, providing further insight into Sherri's motivations, interests, and priorities. This information can be used to develop targeted marketing or product strategies that align with her interests and preferences. An affinity diagram can also generate new ideas and insights that may not be immediately obvious, leading to a more comprehensive understanding of Sherri as a fictional person.</p>

  <h9>Empathy Map</h9>
  <hr class="new2">
  <p> An empathy map can help us better understand Sherri's thoughts, feelings, and motivations as a theme park enthusiast. We can use the information from the bio to identify her pain points, desires, and expectations when it comes to visiting theme parks, which can help us design experiences that better meet her (and others like her) needs. An empathy map can also help us identify potential barriers to Sherri's enjoyment of theme parks, such as long wait times or lack of accessibility, and brainstorm ways to overcome these issues. By creating an empathy map, we can put ourselves in Sherri's shoes and design more meaningful and impactful experiences for her and other theme park enthusiasts.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>To identify Sherri's goals and aspirations regarding theme parks and how these might differ from other visitors' goals and aspirations.</li>
    <li>To ensure that the theme park experience is designed to meet Sherri's needs, preferences, and expectations rather than simply assuming what these are.</li>
    <li>To help understand Sherri's emotions and moods when visiting theme parks and how these might be influenced by different factors such as weather, crowds, and ride availability.</li>
    </ul>

      <h9>Card Sorting </h9>
      <hr class="new2">
      <p>Card sorting can effectively redesign the Universal Studios Orlando website to meet the needs of visitors like Sherri better. By understanding her priorities regarding theme park features and attractions, we could gain insights into her preferences and design website experiences that appeal to her and other theme park enthusiasts. For instance, we could ask visitors to identify and categorize their favorite rides based on accessibility, thrill levels, age-appropriateness, and wait times.
        These insights could inform the redesign of the website, resulting in improved accessibility options, more accurate ride wait time information, and new attractions that align with visitors' interests. Ultimately, card sorting could help us better understand visitors' thought processes on navigating the website and provide a more intuitive, user-friendly web design that better meets the needs of those passionate about theme parks. By understanding visitor preferences and needs, Universal Studios Orlando can improve its online presence and provide visitors with a more seamless and enjoyable experience.</p>

        <h9>Final Thoughts/Conclusion</h9>
      <p>Other groups had done their NPO site redesigns to present a comprehensive set of opportunities for iteration should this project continue. A reorganization of the home page, another editing pass on the text style and writing, and the implementation of an interactive calendar would take precedence. Following that, we could make it, so the form implied by the button in Teach a Class is implemented inside the site, opening up the moment a large orange button is pressed. The box for Sponsors and Donors would also experience a redesign to make the labels much easier to find and read.
        Our group is proud of what we've done to improve upon FamiLAB's old design, but we know we also have a long way to go. We succeeded in cleaning up some elements that were broken or no longer needed, but there's much more to accomplish. With the time we had to deal with sudden emergencies across the team, this could have been much worse.
        The skills we picked will help with possible continuation and future projects. Our auto layout knowledge has expanded further. We know more about using negative space to our advantage. We've also discovered a few intricacies about Figma that lead to issues brought about by our need for more understanding.
        That said, we must account for everything we learned in this process. Unfortunately, we were too harsh on the original site in our presentation, to the point of being called rude. I hope we never make that mistake again.
